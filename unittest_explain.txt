In these test cases, we are using the MagicMock class from the unittest.
mock module to mock the database connection and find method. 
We are then testing two scenarios: 
one where the find method returns a successful response. 
one where it raises an error. 
We assert that the lambda handler returns the expected response in each scenario. 
Note that these test cases assume that the Country_Master collection has documents with a name and population field. 
If this is not the case, you may need to modify the expected results accordingly.
